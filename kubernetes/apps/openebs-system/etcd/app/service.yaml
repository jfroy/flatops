  ##
  ## Ideally we would use SRV records to do peer discovery for initialization.
  ## Unfortunately discovery will not work without logic to wait for these to
  ## populate in the container. This problem is relatively easy to overcome by
  ## making changes to prevent the etcd process from starting until the records
  ## have populated. The documentation on statefulsets briefly talk about it.

  ## The naming scheme of the client and server ports match the scheme that etcd
  ## uses when doing discovery with SRV records.
  ports:
  - name: etcd-client
    port: 2379
  - name: etcd-server
    port: 2380
  - name: etcd-metrics
